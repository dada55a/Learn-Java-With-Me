# Getting Started

For this I will not tell you to install any softwares instead i will use a website called [replit](https://replit.com). I am using brave browser you can use browser of your choice and go to [replit](https://replit.com).

After going to the website make account and after creating account, click on create repl option to create a repl file and seach java in the search box and click on java. After clicking on java click on create repl option. 

```
#note: You can leave the file name empty as replit will choose a random
name for the file
```

Now lets have a look at the screen. At the lefthand corner there is file menu and tool drawer. We can create new files and folders and switch between them in here. Middle is where most of the magic happens. This where code is written. Replit generates a simple hello world program when you create a file. We will look and the code later. And at last the right hand corner is where the output of the program is shown. And at the top there is run button. Run button is used to run the code.

  }
}
```
